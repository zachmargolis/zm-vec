zm-vec : A Simple Vector Library in C
Originally by Zach Margolis

The goal of these files is relatively simple, but still readable code.

To get a sense of the project, check out the sample/main.c file. Ideally, it is a straightforward introduction to, and demonstration of, the project.



Notes

Currently, the project uses structs, and passes structs as arguments. A future version may use pointers/references, but for now, call-by-value seems to work well enough.
